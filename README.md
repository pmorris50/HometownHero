## Installation
Open this application using the website linked below.


## Technology
This application follows the Model-View-Controller paradigm. It uses Handlebars.js for the Views, MySQL2 and Sequelize for the database models and an Express.js back end for the Controller. There is also the ability to sign in using your Google id and password.  It also uses bcrypt to hash passwords and express-session and connect-session-sequelize for authentication. It is deployed using Heroku.


## Usage
This website opens on the home page where there is a summary promoting the camps objectives and a list of the locations and dates of upcoming camps. The user may enter the shop but must sign up or login to navigate off the home page for any other purpose.

Once the user has logged in, the list of available camps is shown with a registration button. When the user clicks on Register, the Registration Form is brought up. When the form is filled out, the waiver form is brought up.
