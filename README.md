## Installation
Open this application using the website linked below.


## Technology
This application uses a React front end. MongoDB is used to store the data and the backend uses express and node. It is deployed using Heroku.


## Usage
This website is designed for a professional/semi-professional athlete to easily use as a template for signing up registrations for a day camp. It is designed to be easily customizable for different sports. The color scheme can also be adjusted to reflect team or university colors.

The home page has a summary promoting the camp's objectives and a list of the locations and dates of upcoming camps. The user may enter the shop but must sign up or login to navigate off the home page for any other purpose.

Once the user has logged in, the list of available camps is shown with a registration button. When the user clicks on Register, the Registration Form is brought up. Once the form is filled out, the waiver form is brought up. Once the waiver form is signed, the user will be brought to the shop to complete the purchase.


## Issues
Deployment is not currently functional through Heroku. There is an issue with the routing that is still being investigated by Prof. Joe Han.
